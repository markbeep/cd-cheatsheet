\section*{x86lite}

x86lite memory consists of $2^{64}$ bytes numbered \texttt{0x00000000} through \texttt{0x0xffffffff}, split into 8-byte quadwords (has to be quadword-aligned). \medskip
	
The stack grows from high addresses to low addresses, \texttt{rsp} points to the top of the stack, \texttt{rbp} points to the bottom of the current stack frame. \medskip

The stack sits at the top of memory space, at the bottom we have code and data followed by the heap.\medskip
	
Registers: \texttt{rax, rbx, rcx, rdx, rsi, rdi, rsp, rbp, rip, r08 - r15} \medskip
	
Flags: \texttt{OF} overflow/underflow, \texttt{SF} sign (1 = negative), \texttt{ZF} zero \medskip
	
Instructions: \texttt{INSTR} \texttt{SRC} \texttt{DEST} (AT\&T syntax), prefix register with \% and immediate values with \$. Note that \texttt{subq} is \texttt{DEST - SRC}.\medskip
	
Operands:
\begin{compactitem}
	\item \texttt{Imm}: 64-bit literal signed integer
	\item \texttt{Lbl}: label representing a machine address
	\item \texttt{Reg}: one of the registers, the value is its content
	\item \texttt{Ind}: machine address
\end{compactitem} \medskip

\texttt{Ind} is  \texttt{offset(base, index)} is calculated \texttt{base + index * 8 + offset}.\medskip
	
x86 assembly is organized into labeled blocks, indicating code locations used by jumps, etc. Program begins execution at designated label (\texttt{main}).\medskip
	
Calling Conventions
\begin{compactitem}
	\item Setup Stack Frame: \texttt{pushq \%rbp} \quad \texttt{movq \%rsp, \%rbp}
	
	\item Teardown: \texttt{popq \%rbp}
		
	\item Caller Save - freely usable by the called code.
	
	\item Callee Save - must be restored by the called code (\texttt{rbp, rsp, rbx, r12-15}).
		
	\item Arguments: In \texttt{rdi, rsi, rdx, rcx, r08, r09} and starting with $n = 7$ in $(n-7) + 2) * 8 + \texttt{rbp}$
		
	\item Return value in \texttt{rax}.

	\item 128 byte "red zone" - scratch pad for the callee (beyond \texttt{rsp}), this means a function can use up to 128 byte without allocationg a stack frame..
\end{compactitem}
